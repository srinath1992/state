# Tahoe-100M
Tahoe-100M is a giga-scale single-cell perturbation atlas consisting of over 100 million transcriptomic profiles from 
50 cancer cell lines exposed to 1,100 small-molecule perturbations. Generated using Vevo Therapeutics' 
Mosaic high-throughput platform, Tahoe-100M enables deep, context-aware exploration of gene function, cellular states, and drug responses at unprecedented scale and resolution.
This dataset is designed to power the development of next-generation AI models of cell biology, 
offering broad applications across systems biology, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

## Dataset Features
We provide multiple tables with the dataset including the main data (raw counts) in the `expression_data` table as well as 
various metadata in the `gene_metadata`,`sample_metadata`,`drug_metadata`,`cell_line_metadata`,`obs_metadata` tables.

The main data can be downloaded as follows:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
tahoe_100m_ds = load_dataset("tahoebio/Tahoe-100M", streaming=True, split="train")
```
Setting `stream=True` instantiates an `IterableDataset` and prevents needing to 
download the full dataset first. See [tutorial](tutorials/loading_data.ipynb) for an end-to-end example.

The expression_data table has the following fields:

| **Field Name**         | **Type**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `genes`                | `sequence<int64>` | Gene identifiers (integer token IDs) corresponding to each gene with non-zero expression in the cell. This sequence aligns with the `expressions` field. The gene_metadata table can be used to map the token_IDs to gene_symbols or ensembl_IDs.

| `expressions`          | `sequence<float32>` | Raw count values for each gene, aligned with the `genes` field. The first entry just marks a CLS token and should be ignored when parsing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `Cell_ID_DepMap`                 | Unique identifier for the cell line in the DepMap project (e.g., *ACH-000681*)                                                                                                           |
| `Cell_ID_Cellosaur`              | Cellosaurus accession ID (e.g., *CVCL_0023*). This is the ID used in the main dataset.                                                                                                   |
| `Organ`                          | Tissue or organ of origin for the cell line (e.g., *Lung*), used to interpret lineage-specific responses and biological context.                                                         |
| `Driver_Gene_Symbol`            | HGNC-approved symbol of a known or putative driver gene with functional alterations in this cell line (e.g., *KRAS*, *CDKN2A*). We report a curated list of driver mutations per cell-line. |
| `Driver_VarZyg`                  | Zygosity of the driver variant (e.g., *Hom* for homozygous, *Het* for heterozygous)                                              |
| `Driver_VarType`                | Type of genetic alteration (e.g., *Missense*, *Frameshift*, *Stopgain*, *Deletion*)                                                          |
| `Driver_ProtEffect_or_CdnaEffect`| Specific protein or cDNA-level annotation of the mutation (e.g., *p.G12S*, *p.Q37*), providing precise information on the variant’s consequence.                                         |
| `Driver_Mech_InferDM`            | Inferred functional mechanism of the mutation (e.g., *LoF* for loss-of-function, *GoF* for gain-of-function)                     |
| `Driver_GeneType_DM`            | Classification of the driver gene as an *Oncogene* or *Suppressor*                                                                      |
